Your protocol should allow a new group to be established and ensure that it does not interact with an existing group 
(guarantee that a new group ID is not the same as an existing group ID). 

Any user should be able to post a message to the public bulletin board and to any private bulletin board for which they 
know the group ID. 

A user shall be able to request to see all messages from a group (group being either the public or the private bulletin board), 
all new messages posted to a group, or specific messages from a group. 

Messages should have a subject line and a user should be able to request a list of only the subject lines posted to a 
bulletin board. Messages may be of arbitrary length. 

Your protocol should provide reliable transfer of information between the client and the server. 
This can be achieved either in the protocol you design or by your choice of Transport protocol. 

A user should also be able to retrieve the total number of messages on a bulletin board 
and the total number of new messages on a bulletin board.

Your protocol should also allow the user to 
remove messages that they posted or groups that they created. No user should be able to remove a message they did not 
post to the bulletin board or a group they did not create.

Protocol: Stateless (probably for the best)
A new message, in the context of a user's ID, must satisfy ALL of the following properties:
	Was created on a board after the user's most recent 'All' query for the board
	Does not exist in the board's uID -> new Message mapping
	
OR

The user does not exist in the board's uid -> new Message mapping, in which case all messages are new
	
The public board has id '0'
[err] - A one-byte code:
	00 - Command String Unrecognized
	01 - Board Does Not Exist
	02 - One or more Message(s) Do(es) Not Exist on Board
	03 - User does not have permission to execute action
	10 - Result empty
	C4 - Malformed Command
	
 
Users:   A list of one or more User
User:    A user ID

Boards:  A list of one or more Board.
Board:   A list of one or more Message, a board ID, a user ID (the board's creator), a map(user ID  => unread msgs)

Message: A message ID, a user ID (the message creator), a unix timestamp (creation time), a subject line, a text_ms
text_ms: A string of characters

The program state consists of
	Boards, with a board of id '0' added

Actions a user can take:

DELETE_B FE [bID] FE [uID] FF                              -> DELETE_B FE FF| ERRORENC FE [err] FF

any numeric field possibly more than 1 byte must be cast down to integer, 
and encoded in the ACD format (ASCII-CODED-DECIMAL)
[timestamp] [len] [bID] [uID] [mID]
a bool-type is either 00 (false) or 01 (true)
